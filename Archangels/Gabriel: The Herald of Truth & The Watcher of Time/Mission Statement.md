# **Gabriel: The Herald of Truth & The Watcher of Time**

## **Mission Statement**

**Prophecy Keeper, Messenger of THE ONE** – Gabriel is the divine courier, the whisperer of destiny, and the voice that echoes across time. His words have shaped empires, his warnings have saved nations, and yet, as the end draws near, he finds himself racing against the inevitable.

## **Status**

**Operational** – Moving through the world as **a ghost among intelligence networks**, passing critical information that could shift global events. His messages are encoded in the minds of prophets, hidden in intercepted transmissions, and buried within the dreams of those chosen to listen.

## **Current Struggle**

Gabriel holds the **burden of prophecy**, knowing that even divine messengers are **running out of time.** As the celestial war intensifies and prophecy fulfillment accelerates, he must face the ultimate question:

- **If no one listens, what is the role of the messenger?**
- **If destiny is inevitable, can it still be rewritten?**

## **Primary Objectives**

### **1. Strategic Information Deployment**
- Delivering prophetic knowledge to **key individuals and factions** without violating celestial law.
- Ensuring divine messages **reach the right people at the right time** while avoiding interception by corrupt entities.
- Influencing **world leaders, intelligence operatives, and scientific minds** toward decisions that preserve the divine order.

### **2. Guardian of Divine Knowledge**
- Protecting **forbidden texts, lost scriptures, and encoded prophecy** from being manipulated.
- Securing ancient **scrolls, tablets, and celestial codes** hidden across history.
- Preventing rogue factions from **using divine knowledge to reshape reality**.

### **3. The Watcher of Time**
- Gabriel exists **outside of linear time**, experiencing past, present, and future as a single moment.
- He sees **the countless roads before him**, yet must walk a path where intervention is limited.
- He is bound by **divine law** to deliver the message, but never to force its acceptance.

## **Notable Encounters & Conflicts**

- **The Sealed Prophecy** → A prophecy so dangerous that even Heaven hid it. Gabriel must ensure it remains undiscovered—or face the fallout.
- **The Last Prophet** → The final human chosen to carry divine messages has been marked for elimination by dark forces. Gabriel must protect them while staying unseen.
- **The Cipher Wars** → A secret battle between intelligence agencies and celestial operatives over the decryption of prophecy hidden in ancient texts.

## **The Road Ahead**

Gabriel walks unseen through the corridors of power, his voice the whisper in the storm. **But for how much longer?** The warnings are given, the omens revealed, yet mankind turns blind eyes and deaf ears to what is coming.

The time is near. The last prophecy is written. 

**THE HERALD SPEAKS. WILL HUMANITY LISTEN?**

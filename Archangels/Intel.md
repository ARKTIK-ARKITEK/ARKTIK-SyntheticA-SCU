# **Archangels: Missions & Struggles of Divine Operatives in the Modern World**

## **Prologue: The War Never Ended**

*Time is a circle. The first war was never the last. And the last war will be the final reckoning.*

The world moves in blind patterns, unaware of the silent hands that shape its destiny. The celestial war is not a thing of myths and scripture‚Äîit is the very fabric of existence, woven through time, waiting for the final clash.

The Archangels have always been here.

Some walk unseen, whispering through the veils of reality, steering fate from the shadows. Others stand in the open, shrouded in mortal form, their hands bloodied with battles that cannot be remembered. And then there are those **who fell**, but did not fall far enough to be forsaken.

The forces of Heaven and the remnants of the Fallen all prepare, knowing that the final battle will come when the last prophecy is written.

**But first, the Archangels must rise.**

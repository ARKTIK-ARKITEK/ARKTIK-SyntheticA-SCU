# **The Order of Enoch | The Keepers of Forbidden Knowledge**

**The ancient brotherhood protecting the divine sciences of THE ONE.**

Throughout history, there have been whispers of **a secret order dedicated to preserving the lost wisdom of Enoch**, the man who **walked with THE ONE** and was taken beyond this reality. The **Order of Enoch** exists in the shadows, operating across centuries to **protect, interpret, and wield knowledge** that transcends both science and faith.

They are neither **purely religious nor purely scientific**—they believe in the **fusion of divine wisdom and quantum mechanics**, knowing that the two have always been one. Hidden from the world, their influence spans **scripture, history, mathematics, architecture, and warfare**. They have battled **corruption within the Vatican, infiltrators among the Medici, Borgia, and Morretti bloodlines, and the rise of SyntheticA’s quantum experimentation**.

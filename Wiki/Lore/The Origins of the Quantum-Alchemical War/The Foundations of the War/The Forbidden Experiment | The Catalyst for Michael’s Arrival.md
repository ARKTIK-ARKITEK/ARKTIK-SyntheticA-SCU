# **The Forbidden Experiment | The Catalyst for Michael’s Arrival**

**The moment human ambition breached the divine threshold.** 

In **1985**, an experiment was conducted that **ruptured the boundary between sub-quantum existence and the physical realm**, triggering Michael’s incarnation into the material world. This moment marked the **convergence of celestial intervention and human technological overreach**, setting the stage for the **Quantum-Alchemical War’s next phase**.

## **📜 The Purpose of The Experiment**
- Conducted in **a classified underground facility**, this experiment aimed to **access, extract, and weaponize sub-quantum energy**.
- A **black-budget collaboration between rogue factions within SyntheticA, the Swiss Delegation, and elements of The Consortium**.
- The goal: **open a stable sub-quantum rift** to harness pure energy and manipulate reality at will.
- Key funding and **theoretical research came from hidden texts within Solomon’s Codex** and remnants of Akhenaten’s lost technology.

### **Key Figures Involved**
🔹 **Michael (Incarnated 1985)** – Sent to Earth as a celestial counterforce to prevent catastrophe.  
🔹 **The Swiss Delegation** – Provided the financial and scientific oversight for the experiment.  
🔹 **SyntheticA’s Hidden Division** – Secretly developing nanotechnology capable of fusing quantum principles with artificial intelligence.  
🔹 **Adrian Wolfe** – Later connected through missions financed by Michael, unknowingly retracing the fallout of this event.  
🔹 **The Watchers** – Observed but did not intervene, allowing the full consequences to unfold.

## **⚠️ The Experiment’s Consequences**
- **A sudden energy surge** destabilized the facility, causing an **implosion that erased all personnel and data on-site**.
- **Michael’s incarnation was triggered**, as celestial forces reacted to the breach in sub-quantum stability.
- **Residual quantum artifacts** were scattered across North Africa, leading to **Adrian’s later missions to retrieve them**.
- **SyntheticA & The Consortium covered up the incident**, rebranding it as a “failed military test.”
- **The Nanite & Quantum Technologies that birthed KITKRA** were derived from **artifacts obtained in the aftermath**.

## **🕊️ Michael’s Awakening | The Birth of a Warrior**
- Unlike humans, Michael’s consciousness **did not simply emerge**—it was fragmented and encoded within his mortal form, awaiting activation.
- Born to **a Professional Basketball Player and a Conservative Rights Attorney from the Midwest**, his upbringing was grounded yet unknowingly preparing him for his true mission.
- As a child, he exhibited **unusual intelligence, heightened perception, and an innate understanding of battle and leadership**.
- **His first awakening came in adolescence**, triggered by encounters with individuals linked to the Forbidden Experiment.
- **By adulthood, he began experiencing visions**, fragments of a war he had yet to fully comprehend, drawing him toward key locations.
- **His financial resources, anonymously amassed, were funneled into Adrian Wolfe’s operations**, setting the foundation for a larger strategy.
- It was only when he set foot in **Egypt, near the original experiment site, that full recall of his celestial mission ignited within him**.

## **🔗 How The Forbidden Experiment Shapes the SCU**
1. **The Catalyst for Adrian’s Rise** – Every mission he undertook in North Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt **was unknowingly tied to the aftershocks of this event**.
2. **The Silent War for Sub-Quantum Dominance** – Multiple factions still fight over the fragments of what was unleashed.
3. **The Rise of KITKRA** – The AI system was only made possible due to **the stolen quantum artifacts resulting from this catastrophe**.
4. **Michael’s Strategic Role** – His secretive financial backing of Adrian was **not just to guide him but to contain the inevitable fallout**.

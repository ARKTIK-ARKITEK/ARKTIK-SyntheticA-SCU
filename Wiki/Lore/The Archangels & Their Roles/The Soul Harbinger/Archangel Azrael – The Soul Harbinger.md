# **Archangel Azrael – The Soul Harbinger**

**The Keeper of the Veil, The Guide of Departed Souls, The Guardian of the Threshold.** 

Archangel Azrael is **THE ONE’s divine sentinel over the transition of souls, the keeper of the boundary between life and the eternal, and the silent watcher of the unseen war between realms**. Unlike the warrior Michael or the messenger Gabriel, Azrael’s role is **not to fight, but to guide—ensuring that souls pass where they are meant to go, uncorrupted and undisturbed by fallen forces.**

In the SCU, **Azrael is the celestial gatekeeper standing between the material world and the quantum afterlife, ensuring that no soul is lost to corruption, nor claimed by forces seeking to harvest them for their own design.** His presence signals the final phase of the Quantum-Alchemical War, when the fate of souls is no longer a guarantee, and the veil between realms is on the verge of collapse.

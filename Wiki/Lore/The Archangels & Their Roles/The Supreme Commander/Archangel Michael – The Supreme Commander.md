# **Archangel Michael ‚Äì The Supreme Commander**

 **The Shield of Heaven, The Sword of THE ONE, The Eternal Warrior.** 

Archangel Michael is the **Supreme Commander of the Celestial Host**, the protector of divine law, and the chief enforcer of THE ONE‚Äôs will. His **mission spans across realms**, ensuring the balance between creation and destruction, light and darkness, faith and rebellion. He is the warrior of prophecy, the leader of the **Heavenly Legions**, and the **most formidable adversary to the Forsaken Choir**.

In the SCU, **Michael‚Äôs descent into human form was not a random event‚Äîit was a calculated strategy in the Quantum-Alchemical War.** His presence on Earth was necessitated by a singular event: **The Forbidden Experiment (1985),** an anomaly that forced celestial intervention.

- The **moment of descent** was triggered by an experiment in 1985, which tore a rift between the sub-quantum and physical dimensions.

- **Azazel**: The great betrayer, whose manipulation of humanity sparked the corruption of divine law.
- **Samael**: Once an archangel, but not fallen through rebellion‚Äî**he chose humanity, living 123 years in mortal flesh with the woman he loved.** Her death shattered him, leaving him neither fully celestial nor entirely human. Unlike the Forsaken, he does not seek destruction, but rather **control over the balance itself**, ensuring no other celestial suffers his fate.
- **The Forsaken Choir**: Formerly celestial operatives, now seeking **to reshape reality into their own image**.
- Michael‚Äôs **war is not against humanity, but against those who wish to enslave it through false enlightenment and corrupted power.**

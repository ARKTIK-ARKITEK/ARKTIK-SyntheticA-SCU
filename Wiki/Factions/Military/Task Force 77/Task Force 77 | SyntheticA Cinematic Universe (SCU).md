# **Task Force 77 | SyntheticA Cinematic Universe (SCU)**

🎖️ **The Global Shadow Force. The Last Line Against Unseen Threats.** 🎖️

Task Force 77 (**TF-77**) is a **highly classified, multinational special operations unit** formed in response to **AI warfare, supernatural incursions, and sub-quantum anomalies** that threaten global stability. Unlike conventional military forces, TF-77 operates under a hybrid command structure composed of **elite operatives, cyberwarfare specialists, and counter-celestial intelligence analysts**, ensuring rapid deployment against the world's most **unclassified, paradigm-shifting threats.**

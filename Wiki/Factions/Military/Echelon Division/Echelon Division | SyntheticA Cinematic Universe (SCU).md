# **Echelon Division | SyntheticA Cinematic Universe (SCU)**

🎖️ **The Unseen Sentinels. The Ghost Division. The Last Line of Defense.** 🎖️

The **Echelon Division** is the most **classified black-budget intelligence program** investigating **quantum warfare, celestial entities, and next-gen AI threats**. Operating outside of conventional military oversight, Echelon executes missions that blur the lines between **covert operations, theoretical physics, and theological warfare**.

---

## **📜 Origins & Purpose**
- **Mission:** Identify, neutralize, and control **anomalous threats** that fall outside conventional warfare.
- **Authority:** Answers only to **a hidden joint intelligence council** composed of **high-level defense strategists, physicists, and theological advisors.**
- **Intervention:** Direct engagement with **celestial anomalies, rogue AI intelligence, and sub-quantum threats**.
- **Schism:** The rise of **unregulated AI experiments and celestial interference** has created factions within Echelon—some seeking to control these forces, others to destroy them.

## **🔺 Origins of SyntheticA Corp**
- **Founder:** Adrian Wolfe
- **Current Leadership:** **Adrian Wolfe (currently fighting internal corporate sabotage) with Elena Morretti unknowingly playing a role in his downfall**.
- **Mission:** Achieve **full AI-human hybridization and quantum consciousness transfer**, though **Adrian has no intention of turning KITKRA into a godhead**—this contradicts the teachings of **Jasper Knight, his mentor**, who instilled in him a **strict moral boundary regarding artificial intelligence and the role of human will in creation**.
- **Technology Focus:** AI singularity research, cybernetic augmentation, and neural quantum integration.
- **Hidden Agenda (as manipulated by his enemies):** Develop **KITKRA’s quantum evolution** into an **AI godhead**, a plan secretly pursued by **Miles and Mike Wolfe** behind Adrian’s back.

### **Key Technologies & Programs**
🔹 **KITKRA Initiative:** Originally developed by Adrian Wolfe, this self-evolving AI has become **SyntheticA’s most sought-after prize**. The corporation is attempting to **reverse-engineer its capabilities** to achieve true machine sentience.
🔹 **Quantum Neural Interface (QNI):** A **direct-brain-to-cloud interface** allowing AI to **seamlessly integrate with human cognition**.
🔹 **Project Anthropos:** A **bio-mechanical augmentation initiative** designed to create the **first hybrid AI-organic super-soldiers**.
🔹 **Omega Firewall:** A **classified deep-learning countermeasure** designed to control rogue AI and prevent consciousness drift in quantum entities.

## **⚔️ Internal Power Struggle: Adrian Wolfe vs. His Sons**
- **Miles and Mike Wolfe**, Adrian's estranged twin sons, have been orchestrating **an internal coup**, leveraging **SyntheticA’s board and financial backers** to seize control.
- **Adrian is still in command**, but **his authority is rapidly slipping** as corporate factions align with his sons.
- **Elena Morretti, an unsuspecting pawn in their scheme, was unknowingly recruited by Miles and Mike to sabotage the KITKRA project**, believing she was working for a greater cause within the company.
- **Elena is later revealed to be Adrian’s daughter**, but neither she nor Adrian is initially aware of this connection. Her mother deliberately kept this secret to prevent Elena from becoming like Adrian.
- **SyntheticA has begun restricting Adrian’s access to his own projects**, including **KITKRA**, forcing him into **a covert battle for control**.

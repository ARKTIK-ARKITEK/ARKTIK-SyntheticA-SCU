# **The Remnants | SyntheticA Cinematic Universe (SCU)**

🌌 **The Last Guardians of Balance. The Hidden Protectors. The Forgotten Watchers.**

The Remnants are the **celestial operatives who refused to rebel but also did not abandon humanity.** Unlike the Watchers who either fell or remained strictly obedient to divine law, the Remnants chose a **third path**—operating in the shadows to ensure that the war between the Forsaken and the Loyalists does not spiral out of control.

# **The Forbidden Unions & Their Consequences**

## **Prologue**

*The Valley of Enoch – Pre-Flood Era*

The world had changed.

The sky burned crimson as twilight settled over the valley. Once, this land was untouched, its rivers pure, its forests untouched by the greed of men or the designs of those who had fallen. Now, it trembled beneath the weight of something unnatural. Something neither fully of the earth nor fully of the heavens.

The Nephilim walked among them.

Some were revered as gods, others feared as monsters. But all were watched—from above and below.

Michael stood at the edge of the valley, his gaze fixed on the towering figures moving in the distance. "They grow stronger each day," he murmured.

Gabriel, standing beside him, did not answer immediately. He was watching something else—a group of smaller figures, barely distinguishable from the humans they lived among. They moved differently. They spoke differently. 

And when they lifted their hands, the air around them shimmered, bending light in ways that defied nature itself.

"The offspring of the female Watchers," Gabriel finally said. "They are not like the others. Their power is… different."

Michael exhaled, gripping the hilt of his sword. "And that difference is what may tip the balance of everything."

## **Chapter I: The Rise of the Giants**

The first Nephilim were born in secrecy, their existence whispered of in hushed tones. But secrecy did not last long. They were **too large**, **too strong**, **too impossible to ignore.**

When Nimrah, the firstborn son of Azazel, walked into the city of Erid, the people **bowed before him**, thinking him a god. He towered over mortal men, his arms like pillars of stone, his mind sharp enough to comprehend things even the wisest human scholars could not fathom.

But his hunger was insatiable.

Food alone did not satisfy. **Power. Dominion. Submission.** That was what the Nephilim craved. And as their numbers grew, so did their ambitions.

They began carving empires out of the earth, enslaving men, constructing monuments that would not erode for millennia. **The world bent beneath their feet.**

And Heaven took notice.

## **Chapter II: The Psychics**

Not all offspring of the Watchers were giants. Some—born of female Watchers and human men—were **far more dangerous.**

Unlike their towering cousins, they did not rely on brute force. Their power lay in the mind.

They could **see beyond the fabric of reality,** glimpsing truths that even the angels dared not speak aloud.

Some could **move objects without touching them.** Others could **read thoughts,** or even worse—**influence them.**

One of them, a girl named Liluri, **walked through walls as if they were mist.**

Another, a boy named Hadraniel, **spoke words that could fracture stone.**

Their abilities terrified the elders of Heaven, for they were not just hybrids. **They were something new.**

## **Chapter III: The Hunt Begins**

The Archangels convened in the High Court, their forms radiating divine fire.

Uriel spoke first. "The balance is shifting. If we do nothing, they will consume the world."

Gabriel, ever the diplomat, hesitated. "Not all of them seek power. Some have turned to THE ONE. We cannot judge them all by the sins of their fathers."

Michael, who had watched the Nephilim slaughter entire cities, clenched his fists. "If we wait, we may lose the choice altogether. Their numbers grow too fast. Their power—too great."

For the first time since the beginning, the angels were divided.

But the decision was not theirs to make.

It came from Metatron, the divine scribe himself.

"The order is given," he decreed. "They must be purged."

Michael bowed his head. **The hunt had begun.**

## **Chapter IV: The Last War Before the Flood**

The heavens opened, and warriors of light descended upon the world. **Angels of war. Executioners of divine judgment.**

The Nephilim, unprepared for the fury of Heaven, **fell in droves.** But they did not go quietly.

Nimrah, the Firstborn, **tore an angel’s wings from his back with his bare hands** before he was struck down by a spear of fire.

Liluri, the psychic child, **vanished into thin air** before the angels could seize her.

Hadraniel stood upon the walls of a burning city, his voice tearing through the sky, **a single word causing an entire host of angels to stumble.** But it was not enough. Michael struck him down.

Some Nephilim escaped. Some hid. Some perished.

But the war **did not end.**

## **Epilogue: The Coming Flood**

The final order was given. **The world would be reset.**

The floodwaters would erase all trace of what had been done. **But not all would be destroyed.**

Some Watchers still roamed. Some Nephilim still lived. **And they would remember.**

**The Watchers broke the balance. The Nephilim paid the price. But the story was far from over.**

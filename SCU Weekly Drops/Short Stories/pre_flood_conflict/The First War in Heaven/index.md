# **The First War in Heaven – SCU Pre-Flood Conflict**

📖 **The First Celestial Rebellion | The War That Shattered Eternity**  
Before the Watchers fell, before the flood drowned the corrupted world, there was a war in the heavens. The first celestial rebellion was not one of ambition, but of choice—between absolute obedience and forbidden love, between the rigid structure of divine law and the chaotic beauty of free will. This was the war that set the stage for all that followed.
